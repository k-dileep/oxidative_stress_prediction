Abstract- This study investigates oxidative stress in children exposed to cell phone and cell tower radiation by developing a predictive
 model for Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity by analyzing key parameter radiation exposure levels and fibrinogen concentration to
 predict SOD activity. A neural network model with polynomial feature transformation was implemented to capture non-linear
 relationships between exposure and oxidative stress markers. The model achieved accuracy of 85%.
