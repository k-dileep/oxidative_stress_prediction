Abstract- This study investigates oxidative stress in children exposed to cell phone and cell tower radiation by developing a predictive
 model for Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity by analyzing key parameter radiation exposure levels and fibrinogen concentration to
 predict SOD activity.A neural network model and decision tree regression algorithms is used.
 A neural network model with polynomial feature transformation was implemented to capture non-linear
 relationships between exposure and oxidative stress markers. The model achieved accuracy of 85%.
